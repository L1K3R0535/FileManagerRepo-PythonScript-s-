# FileManagerRepo-PythonScript-s-
This repo contains a file management tool(only for Debian based Linux at first, that will change) Basically I just wanted it to be seperate from the private stuff I am working on for 'AutomationMadness' though it could kind of go in there. Yes that will be public one day(sometime in the next month or two)
