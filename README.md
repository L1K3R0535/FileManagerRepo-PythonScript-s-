# FileManagerRepo-PythonScript-s-
This repo contains a file management tool(only for Debian based Linux at first, that will change) Basically I just wanted it to be seperate from the private stuff I am working on for 'AutomationMadness' though it could kind of go in there. Yes that will be public one day(sometime in the next month or two)

Plus the external Base64 conversion script that is used in the program (plus any others that I end up makeing).

To explain a reson for this? Perfectly fair to say that it is a pointless script, because it is in a way, just learning the command line would suit some people's needs far better than this 'program' can. But none the less, when I was having a tough time just getting into all this thing called computer science. I wrote this script for a few reasons...

1) To help my understanding of the python language.

2) To help my understanding of the command line a bit more.

3) That it may serve as a good example for other people haveing the same problems I did when first starting out.

4) To have a program where things can be constantly added/refined when I feel like doing so.

5) Can do some cool things(automaticaly), on days when I am being too lazy, to just use the command line.
