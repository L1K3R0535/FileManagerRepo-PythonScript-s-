# FileManagerRepo-PythonScript-s-
This repo contains various tools/scripts for file managment & and information gathering, very, very basic automation of said taks(only for Debian based Linux at first, that will change) Basically I just wanted it to be seperate from the private stuff I am working on for 'AutomationMadness' though it could kind of go in there. Yes that will be public one day(sometime in the future)

But please consider this just a free showcase of this kind of thing to hopefully help at least one person.


To explain a reson for this? Perfectly fair to say that it is a pointless script, because it is in a way, just learning the command line would suit some people's needs far better than this 'program' can. But none the less, when I was having a tough time just getting into all this thing called computer science. I wrote this script for a few reasons...

1) To help my understanding of the python language.

2) To help my understanding of the command line a bit more.

3) That it may serve as a good example for other people haveing the same problems I did when first starting out.

4) To have a program where things can be constantly added/refined when I feel like doing so.

5) Can do some cool things(automaticaly), on days when I am being too lazy, to just use the command line.
